Installation
------------

- clone this repository
- `cd lg_skbuild_template`
- `pip install .`

Customize library name, python package name and pip package name
------------

By default, lg_skbuild_template will use the following names:
* The library for which we build bindings is "example_lib_cpp"
* The name of the python package that binds this library is "example_lib" (this name cannot include "-").
  This python package include a native module named "_example_lib" which provides the bindings.
* The name of the pip package is "example-lib" (this name cannot include "_")
  (the pip package name can be slightly different from the python package name)

Call `python prepare_template.py` in order to customize this template with your own names. This will replace in files, 
and rename files and folders accordingly. After this, it is advised to remove prepare_template.py.

Autogenerate the binding code 
------------
Install litgen
````
pip install -r requirements-dev.txt
````

Then run:
````
python autogenerate_example_lib.py
````

This will:
* Create an amalgamated header file for the library in `example_lib_cpp_amalgamation.h`
* Write the cpp binding code into `bindings/pybind_example_lib_cpp.cpp`
* Write the python stub code into `bindings/example_lib/__init__.pyi`

You can of course adapt the code and litgen options inside `autogenerate_example_lib.py`

CI Examples
-----------

There are examples for CI in `.github/workflows`. A simple way to produces
binary "wheels" for all platforms is illustrated in the "wheels.yml" file,
using [`cibuildwheel`][].
